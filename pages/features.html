                        <p>AppEx is a planning and reporting tool for anyone with coordinative responsibilities in a project
                            (architects, general contractors, construction managers, owner representatives). AppEx can be
                            deployed by individuals or firms of any size and allows the accumulation of personal or corporate
                            knowledge.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> AppEx operates on a customizable framework of project phases and construction/planning disciplines.
                            This unique array perspective ensures that experiences from latter project phases are captured
                            and turned into planning activities in preceding phases on future projects. For each phase and
                            discipline users create planning worksheets with a blend of personal lessons and relevant lessons
                            from a large database.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> For reporting purposes an overview array shows at a glance the project status with activities that
                            have been checked for quality and open issues. This gives owners the assurance that lessons are
                            being applied in the planning of activities and work products are checked for quality at every
                            phase of a project.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The software interacts with users at defined milestones to capture their new experiences and lessons,
                            ensuring the continuous accumulation and sharing of experiences and knowledge.</p>
